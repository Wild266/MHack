        a)    Dua for the best of both worlds

Rabbana atinafee addunya hasanatan wafee al-akhiratihasanatan waqina AAathaba annar.
Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.
{Surat Al Baqarah 2 : Ayaah 201}

b)    Dua during Distress (Keeping in mind as humans we are never “totally” free from distress,thus making this dua constantly is very beneficial.)

None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the incomparably great, the compassionate. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the rub of the mighty throne. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the rub of the heavens, the rub of the earth, and the rubb of the honorable throne.
[Sahih Al Bukhari]

Indeed my salah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am one of the Muslims.

j)      Dua for confessing your Sins – Dua of Yunus aleyhi salaam.
If you know what verse follows this verse you will never stop making this dua! SubhanAllah. May Allah answer our prayers as He responded to the call of our beloved Prophet Yunus aleyhi salaam.

La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inneekuntu mina aththalimeen
[none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)], Glorified (and Exalted) are You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something that, if any worldly calamity or disaster befalls any man among you and he says these words, he will be relieved of it. (It is) the du’aa’ of Dhu’l-Noon: “Laa ilaaha illa anta subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allaah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers).” According to another report: “No Muslim man says this du’aa’ concerning anything but Allaah will answer his prayer.”
